# Live Magpie terminal E2E evidence

- Status: **failed**
- Model: `codex/gpt-6.1-sol`
- Magpie session: `go-cli-live-20261014-a4a77a88b0eb`
- Run nonce: `a4a77a88b0eb`
- Race detector clean: `True`
- Evidence class: real go-cli binary + real PTY + requests transparently forwarded to signed-in Magpie Codex. No model responses are synthesized.
- UI evidence: actual PTY bytes rendered by xterm.js in headless Chromium; screenshots are not native Terminal captures.
- Credential handling: isolated CLI HOME, dummy local API sentinel, no stored Authorization headers, request bodies, or full response bodies.

## Checks

- PASS: actual model response contains requested exact text marker
- PASS: actual upstream assistant response includes exact alpha fixture fact
- PASS: actual upstream assistant response includes exact beta fixture fact
- PASS: actual inference selected ls, literal grep, and read tools
- PASS: both real read tool results were delivered back to the model
- PASS: read calls target both nonce fixture files
- PASS: real tool receipts contain both exact fixture facts
- PASS: default unscoped grep retains zero scope and unknown effect while ls/read retain canonical workspace scope
- PASS: default unscoped grep approval screenshot precedes a successful exact-fact grep receipt and read receipts
- PASS: denied write target was absent before and remains absent after human denial
- PASS: upstream request after denial carries a denied tool receipt
- PASS: human-style write approval produced a file and its matching durable completion proof
- PASS: human-style edit approval applied the exact replacement
- PASS: the model's Edit call has a later receipt and durable quiescent completion proof
- PASS: actual upstream assistant response reports the edited content
- PASS: interactive CLI exited successfully
- PASS: Go race detector reported no DATA RACE in the real PTY session
- PASS: live PTY produced actual Chat Completions inference requests
